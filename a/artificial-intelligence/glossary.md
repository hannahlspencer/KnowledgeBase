# Glossary

#### Corpus

A large and structured collection of text documents or other forms of data that are used for training, testing, or evaluating natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models

#### Embedding

An embedding is data represented by a large array of numbers called a vector that helps compare patterns of relationships.

The numbers link together as a multidimensional map for relationships. For example, dog and puppy are similar words so would be represented by vectors that are close together:

* Dog: \[0.1, 0.51, 0.6, 0.2, 0.8]
* Puppy: \[0.3, 0.5, 0.9, 0.8, 0.4]

Vectors have hundreds of points. A database full of embeddings is called a vector database which can be used to search, cluster, and classify.&#x20;

#### RAG

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It is an AI design pattern that combines an LLM and external knowledge retrieval.

#### Stop word list

A stop word list is a collection of common words that are often filtered out or excluded from text data during the preprocessing phase in NLP and information retrieval tasks because they are not meaningful on their own eg. articles (e.g., "a," "an," "the"), prepositions (e.g., "in," "on," "under"), conjunctions (e.g., "and," "but," "or"), and other frequently occurring words that don't carry significant semantic meaning on their own.&#x20;
