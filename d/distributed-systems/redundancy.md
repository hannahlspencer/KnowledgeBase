# Redundancy

Redundancy is the duplication of critical components or functions to increase reliability, usually in the form of a backup, and removes single points of failure.

Replication means sharing information to ensure consistency between redundant resources which also improves reliability. It’s widely used in many DBMS, in which the main copy ripples updates through its copies, and each copy confirms they’ve received.
