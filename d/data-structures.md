# Data Structures

A Data Structure is the way data is stored and manipulated for retrieval.

#### Linear/Non-Linear Data Structures

Linear structures arrange data in a linear sequence, such as found in an array, list, or queue. In nonlinear structures, the data doesnâ€™t form a sequence but instead connects to two or more information items, like in a tree or graph.



#### Static/Dynamic Data Structures

Static structures consist of fixed, permanent structures and sizes at compile time, for example arrays reserves a set amount of reserve memory set up by the programmer ahead of time.&#x20;

Dynamic structures feature non-fixed memory capacities, shrinking or expanding as required by the program and its execution requirements. Additionally, the location of the associated memory can change. Examples include stack, queue, heap, dynamic array.
